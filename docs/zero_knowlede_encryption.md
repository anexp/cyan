Please feel free to send more such interesting resources to me and I will add it to the list for everyone's benefit. 
I am also preparing the slides for my 'Zero-Knowledge Proofs in Blockchain: Theory and Applications' course. In the mean time, start reading about the documents from these links above. Let me know if you have any questions. Also please feel free to send me the ids of people who are interested in learning about ZK/Cryptography/Blockchain research and engineering to join the group and I shall add them here. Cheers!
